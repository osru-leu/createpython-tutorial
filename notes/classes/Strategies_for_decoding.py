#Strategies for decoding Classes

# Look for the unknowns-
#   Any functions any methods anything you dont know, look up.
# Define it. This will help you trace the code and understand
# the flow

# Trace the code-
#  Straight forward. Follow the code if possible from the inital
#  program, instaniated objects, or call points.
