movie psuedo rando items


Blockbuster is the stack name.
    -utils/db_util.py: db_name = 'Blockbuster"




The collection name is movies
    -self.collection = DBUtil().get_collection(self.collection_name):
        -gets me 'movies'

In the movies collection are documents-the indivivdual movies
    -



ISSUES:
    squigglies under settings in db_util    
        -if all pys are complete and in order, the fallback:
            -copy and paste entire day day_14 folder and
            and remake necessary Blockbuster changes 

DATABASE IMPORT SUCCESSFUL
NEXT:
-Create a py 
    -should be able to give commands and receive commands through
     input funct.
        Commands: 
            -add
            -delete
            -find
        Commands need to execute action in the datatbase
