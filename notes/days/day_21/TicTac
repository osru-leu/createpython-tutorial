what do we need?
    -a BOARD
        -BOARD = matrix of 9 places or a 3x3:
            BOARD = [
                 0  1  2
              0 [1, 2, 3],
              1 [4, 5, 6],
              2 [7, 8, 9]
            ]
        -for every turn print the board in the terminal with current occupied quadrants
        -if making a GUI show board constantly on screen alternate X's and O's for every other turn taken 
        by player(
            while True:
                BOARD
        )
            -ask for input(character placement)
            -return updated board with occupied spaces
            
        -logic that does not allow 2 character X and O to exist in the same quadrant
        -logic that announces a winner when 3 spaces in a row are taken
            if char_x == position
            if char_o == position
    -CHARACTERS X's and O's
        assign first player X's automatically upon choosing space
        char_x = 'X'
        char_o = 'O'

     QUAD_SELECT = input('''Where would you like to place your character?
                            [  1  |  2  |  3  ]
                            [  4  |  5  |  6  ]
                            [  7  |  8  |  9  ]    ''')
