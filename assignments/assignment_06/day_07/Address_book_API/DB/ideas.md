# Ideas for a product

## Problem Statement

* Time consuming task for inventory and nobody likes it.

* Error prune, not in sync, involves multiple applications and touch points.  Not streamlined.

* Inaccurate due to human error.  
  Does it in pairs, one guy is reading it and the other guy is recording it.
  Result of the human error:
    - Affects overall alcohol costs is not accurate (over purchase or under purchase, accounting)
    - Some could manipulate the numbers to hide fraud or inflate the profit margins

* Most of it is recorded on the hard copy.
    - After writing it down, they manually enter it in the computer.
    - Have to compare with the backend inventory.
    - Some distribution companies have websites to enter in the order.
    - Have multiple distributors (can have 1-10)
    - 

* Contraption that you attach to a trash can that will identify the bottle.
    - Low margin of error.

* Open bottles are a pain point because you have to document the percentage used to get a accurate inventory.
    - percentages also depends on cost per oz
    - currently break it down to a tenth.  This has a margin of error and depends on experience.

* light inventory

* COuntry club
    * took multiple hours (dependent on quantity and multiple bar locations and storage)

* Application should account for multiple entry locations in the same venue (pool bar vs outsie bar, etc).
